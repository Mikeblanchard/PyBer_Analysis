# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

Our goal in this analysis was to look at PyBer's activity in the 3 city types, suburban, urban and rural. We focused on total number of rides, drivers and fares as well as average fare per ride and per driver during the months of January to April in these 3 city types. We will extract useful information and develop recommendations for the PyBer CEO.
