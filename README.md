# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

Our goal in this analysis was to look at PyBer's activity in the 3 city types, suburban, urban and rural. We focused on total number of rides, drivers and fares as well as average fare per ride and per driver during the months of January to April in these 3 city types. We will extract useful information and develop recommendations for the PyBer CEO.

## Results

From this chart, we can assert that a concentration of drivers in urban areas drives down the average fare per ride and even more so average fare per driver. This is in keeping with supply and demand principles. We also assume that average ride distance and time is greater the further out of city centers we go.

This line graph show us a couple things. Late February is the most active time for all drivers in all city types. There is a unique pattern in urban areas during the month of March that would require more data to form conclusions about. Perhaps there are concentrations of events and festivals that would account for this trend. The peak of fares in rural ares also has a sharp increase in early April. This could possibly be due to Easter events. 

## Summary 

The most evident conclusions we have reached from this data analysis is that Pyber should maximized its drivers on the road during late February, in all city types. It is possible PyBer is limiting their profits by simply not having enough drivers on the road to meet demand during their busiest period. 

Additionally, Early January is the least profitable period of the moths we looked at. Perhaps limiting the number of drivers during this time would encourage a core group of drivers to stay on. We recommend thinking about forming a team of full-time and and part-time drivers. 

Finally, given the scarcity of rural drivers, we recommend raising the
