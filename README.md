# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

Our goal in this analysis was to look at PyBer's activity in the 3 city types, suburban, urban and rural. We focused on total number of rides, drivers and fares as well as average fare per ride and per driver during the months of January to April in these 3 city types. We will extract useful information and develop recommendations for the PyBer CEO.

## Results

From this chart, we can assert that a concentration of drivers in urban areas drives down the average fare per ride and even more so average fare per driver.
